This is the “Follow Me” Web Application designed by the Team V. We intend to create a recommendation website for the traveler who does not have a clear destination in their mind.

The main page of the web application is formed by the navigate part, the user control part button and the display part. In the display part, we use the waterfall of the photos to present the places in the world. When the user is interested in a photo, she/he can click on the photo to get more knowledge related with it,for example the wiki resources and the google map resources. The Search pages are divided into the Destination Search and the Range Search. In the Destination Search, the user can input the name of the place to get the photos related with this place. In the Range Search, the user can input the name of the place and the range of the place to narrow the search targets, similarly, we output the photos of the target place and range. In the profile, we provide the custom-designed interface of the user, it contains the history views of the user and the personal information.

To use this web application, you need to follow these steps:
1. download the code
2. enter the file that the code is put in using the console
3. input the “npm  install”
4. register a Mongo database
5. change the information in the database.js 
4. input “node server.js”

Then you can see the web application running in the local server. Not you can also upload it in the ElasticBeanStalk.

The key ingredients are : Node.js, Mongo Database, Paranormal API, Google map API, Wiki API, Panoramio API, etc.
